# Pong 3D Proposal

## Background
Pong 3D is a JavaScript clone of Curveball and a 3D version of the game Pong. It features a 3D field and allows players to interact with a ball and an opponent paddle in order to score a goal.

## Functionality and MVP
At minimum, players should be able to:

- [ ] See modal with game introduction and a 'play' button
- [ ] Move 'human player' paddle in close 2-D space
- [ ] Interact with 'CPU' paddle (AI) in far 2-D space
- [ ] Play until one player loses all 3 lives

The project will also include:
- [ ] Production Readme

## Architecture and Technologies
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla Javascript for game physics computations
- `HTML5 Canvas` to create playing field and game pieces (ball and paddles)
- CSS for styling game display

## Implementation Timeline
** Day 1 ** Render ball, paddle, and field
** Day 2 ** Scale ball size/distance, speed/curving
** Day 3 ** Create AI for CPU paddle

## Bonus
- [ ] Sounds
